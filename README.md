Overview: Electricity monitoring systems require data storage mechanisms that not only record consumption values but also preserve historical changes to ensure data integrity and accountability. This paper proposes the integration of a bitememporal database architecture with machine learning models to support analysis and prediction of daily electricity consumption data, including kWh and voltage measurements. The bitemporal design is implemented using PostgreSQL with a system-versioned table approach based on the SQL:2011 standard, enabling each record to be managed through valid time and transaction time dimensions. This mechanism allows accurate retrieval of historical data states (as-was) and current conditions (as-is). Data processing is conducted using Python, involving data cleaning, feature extraction, and normalization. Three machine learning algorithms, namely Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest, are employed to model the relationship between voltage and energy consumption. Experimental results indicate that the bitemporal schema effectively maintains complete historical records, while the machine learning models demonstrate reliable performance in consumption modeling. The proposed approach enhances data transparency, improves information quality, and provides a robust foundation for developing reliable electricity monitoring systems


Conclution on This Project: This study presents an integrated bitemporal data management framework that combines PostgreSQL system-versioned temporal tables with machine-learning-based anomaly detection to improve the integrity and auditability of electricity consumption data. The implementation results demonstrate that the bitemporal schema successfully preserves complete historical versions of kWh and voltage records, allowing precise execution of both as-was and as-is queries. The temporal tracking of valid time and transaction time enables accurate reconstruction of past data states and supports comprehensive evaluation of data provenance.
The preprocessing and analytical stages performed in Python enabled effective temporal feature extraction, including transaction delay and value-change indicators. These features were successfully utilized by the Isolation Forest model to detect suspicious backdated updates, showing the potential of machine learning as an automated data quality assurance mechanism in temporal database environments.
Overall, the proposed Bi-Temporal framework provides a robust end-to-end solution for temporal data storage, historical version control, and anomaly detection in smart-meter electricity monitoring systems. Future work may extend this architecture to real-time streaming data, larger-scale deployments, and more advanced ML models to enhance detection accuracy and operational scalability.
